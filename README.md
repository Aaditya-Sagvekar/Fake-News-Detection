# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that identifies whether a news article is **Real** or **Fake** using NLP techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and classification algorithms.  
This repository contains the dataset, preprocessing steps, model training pipeline, evaluation metrics, and final model files.
